# Basic-Image-Classification-Using-Tensorflow

### This project involves basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a basic image classification problem. I created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that is able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. 
####  Concepts used : 
1.Fundamentals of neural networks <br>
2. TensorFlow<br>
3. Keras
4. The famous MNIST dataset

### Steps:

1. Encode the labels

2. Understand neural networks

3. Preprocess image examples

4. Create a neural network model

5. Train the model to fit the dataset

6. Evaluate the model

7. Visualize the predictions
